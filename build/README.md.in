# Name

Native::LibC - The C standard library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cygx/p6-native-libc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cygx/p6-native-libc)

# Synopsis

```
    use Native::LibC <malloc fopen puts free>;

    my $buf = malloc(1024);
    my $file = fopen('LICENSE', 'r');

    loop { puts(chomp $file.gets($buf, 1024) // last) }

    $file.close;
    free($buf);
```

# Description

Provides access to the C standard library. It's accompanied by the module
`Native::Array` that patches the NativeCall Pointer class, adding an
`rw` accessor as well as providing an iterable wrapper over `CArray`.

This is still work in progress and not a finished product.


# Building

The file `p6-native-libc.c` needs to be compiled into a shared library named
`p6-native-libc.[so|dll|...]`.

You can try to use panda or the Makefile, but no guarantees.

On Windows, use the wrapper batch scripts for MSVC nmake or MinGW gmake.


# LibC API

Overview over the `libc::` namespace, a lexical alias for `Native::LibC::`.

Anything that's missing from this list still needs to be implemented.
