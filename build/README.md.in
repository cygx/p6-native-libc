# Native::LibC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cygx/p6-native-libc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cygx/p6-native-libc)

The C standard library

# Synopsis

```
    use Native::LibC <malloc fopen puts free>;

    my $buf = malloc(1024);
    my $file = fopen('LICENSE', 'r');

    loop { puts(chomp $file.gets($buf, 1024) // last) }

    $file.close;
    free($buf);
```

# Description

Provides access to the C standard library. It's accompanied by the module
`Native::Array` that provides an iterable wrapper over `CArray` as well as
patching `NativeCall::Pointer`, among other things adding an `rw` accessor.

This is still work in progress and not a finished product. Feel free to
[open a ticket](https://github.com/cygx/p6-native-libc/issues/new) if you
need a particular feature that's still missing.


# Building

The file `p6-native-libc.c` needs to be compiled into a shared library named
`p6-native-libc.[so|dll|...]`.

You can try using the Makefile, ie

    make
    make test
    make install PREFIX=/path/to/share/perl6/site

but no guarantees.

On Windows, use the wrapper batch scripts for MSVC nmake or MinGW gmake as
appropriate.


# LibC API

Overview over the `libc::` namespace, a lexical alias for `Native::LibC::`.

Anything that's missing from this list still needs to be implemented.
